                           <h3>Sources of Workload Evaluation</h3>
          <p>Throughout this experiment the rating scales are used to assess your experiences in the different
            task conditions. Scales of this sort are extremely useful but their utility suffers from the tendency people
            have to interpret them in individual ways. For examples, some people feel that mental or temporal demands are
            the essential aspects of workload regardless of the effort they expended on a given task or the level of
            performance they achieved. Others feel that if they performed well the workload must have been low and if
            they performed badly it must have been high. Yet others feel that effort or feelings of frustration are the
            most important factors in workload; and so on. The result of previous studies have already found every
            conceivable patters on values. In addition, the factors that create levels of workload differs depends on
            the task. For example, some tasks might be difficult because they must be completed very quickly.
            Other may seem easy or hard because of the intensity of mental or physical effort required. Yet others feel
            difficult because they cannot be performed well, no matter how much effort is expended.</p>

<p>The evaluation you are about to perform is a technique that has been developed by NASA to assess the relative
  importance of six facts in determining how much workload you experienced. The procedure is simple: you will be
  presented with a series of pairs of rating scale titles (for examples Effort vs Mental Demands) and asked to
  choose which of the terms was more important to your experience of workload in the task(s) that you just
  performed. Each pair scale titles will appear in a different page.</p>

<p>Select the scale title that represents the more important contributor to workload for the specific
  task you performed in this experiment.</p>

<p>After you finished the entire series we will be able to use the pattern of your choices to create a weighted
  combination of the rations from that task into a summary workload score. Please consider your choices carefully
  and make them consistent with how you used the rating scales during the particular task you were asked to evaluate.
  Donâ€™t think that there is any correct pattern, we are only interested in your opinion.</p>

<p>If you have any question, please ask them now. Otherwise, start whenever you are ready. Thank you for your
  participation.</p>
