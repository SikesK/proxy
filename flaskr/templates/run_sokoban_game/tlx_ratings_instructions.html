          <p>We are not only interested in assessing your performance but also the experiences you
had during the different task conditions. Right now we are going to describe the
technique that will be used to examine your experiences. In the most general sense we are
examining the “Workload" you experienced. Workload is a difficult concept to define
precisely, but a simple one to understand generally. The factors that influence your
experience of workload may come from the task itself, your feelings about your own
performance, how much effort you put in, or the stress and frustration you felt, The
workload contributed by different task elements may change as you get more familiar
with a task, perform easier or harder versions of it, or move from one task to another.
Physical components of workload are relatively easy to conceptualize and evaluate.
              However, the mental components of workload may be more difficult to measure.</p>


<p>Since workload is something that is experienced individually by each person, there are
no effective "rulers" that can be used to estimate the workload of different activities. One
way to find out about workload is to ask people to describe the feelings they experienced.
Because workload may be caused by many different factors, we would like you to
evaluate several of them individually rather than lumping them into a single global
evaluation of overall workload. This set of six rating scales was developed for you to use
in evaluating your experiences during different tasks. Please read the descriptions of the
scales carefully. If you have a question about any of the scales in the table, please ask me
about it. It is extremely important that they be clear to you. You may keep the
    descriptions with you for reference during the experiment.</p>

<p>After performing each of the tasks, you will be shown a page with rating scales.
    You will evaluate the task by selecting a point on the six scales that best matches your experience.
    Each line has two endpoint descriptors that describe the scale.
    Note that “own performance” goes from “good” on the left to “bad” on the right.
    This order has been confusing for some people. Consider each scale individually.
    You ratings will play an important role in the evaluation being conducted,
    thus your active participation is essential to the success of this experiment and
    is greatly appreciated by all of us.
